All data and code for the article, ["Weak magnetic field effects in biology are real &mdash it is time to update the scientific consensus"](https://www.google.com).

If you're here to peruse the raw data: first, check folder [10 Posters](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-real/tree/main/10%20Posters), with posters containing 3-day images for all the more than 2,750 tadpoles we tracked.

If you're here to peruse the analysis code: first, check folder [1 Utilities](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-real/tree/main/1%20Utilities). This folder contains the code for the automated image analysis; most auxiliary functions are found in the file [utilities.py](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-real/blob/main/1%20Utilities/utilities.py). The statistical analysis plots of a desired property, by day and for all batches, are generated by the file [StatsAndPlots.py](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-real/blob/main/1%20Utilities/StatsAndPlots.py).
