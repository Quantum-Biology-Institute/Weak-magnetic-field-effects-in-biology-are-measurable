All data and code for the article, ["Weak magnetic field effects in biology are measurableâ€”accelerated _Xenopus_ embryogenesis in the absence of the geomagnetic field"](https://www.google.com). In the article, Supplementary Section SI69 is a guide to this GitHub repository. 

If you're here to peruse the data: first, check folder [10 Posters](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-measurable/tree/main/10%20Posters), with posters containing 3-day images for all the more than 2,750 tadpoles we tracked. In the article, Supplementary Section SI71 is a guide to these posters. 

If you're here to peruse the analysis code: first, check folder [1 Utilities](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-measurable/tree/main/1%20Utilities). This folder contains the code for the automated image analysis; most auxiliary functions are found in the file [utilities.py](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-measurable/blob/main/1%20Utilities/utilities.py). The statistical analysis plots of a desired property, by day and for all batches, are generated by the file [StatsAndPlots.py](https://github.com/Quantum-Biology-Institute/Weak-magnetic-field-effects-in-biology-are-measurable/blob/main/1%20Utilities/StatsAndPlots.py). In the article, Supplementary Section SI73 is a guide to the python code deposited here.
